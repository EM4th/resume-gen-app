- **Network Access**: http://10.2.0.2:8080
- **Status**: Running on all network interfaces

## Testing on Your Mobile Device

### Method 1: Same WiFi Network (Recommended)
1. **Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network**
   - Your Mac and mobile device must be connected to the same WiFi
   
2. **Open your mobile browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://10.2.0.2:8080
   ```

3. **If that doesn't work, try finding your Mac's IP:**
   - On Mac: System Preferences â†’ Network â†’ WiFi â†’ Advanced â†’ TCP/IP
   - Look for "IPv4 Address" (should start with 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x)

### Method 2: Using ngrok (External Access)
If you want to test from anywhere or if the local network method doesn't work:

1. **Install ngrok:**
   ```bash
   brew install ngrok
   ```

2. **Run ngrok in a new terminal:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8080
   ```

3. **Use the ngrok URL:**
   - ngrok will provide a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
   - Access this URL from any mobile device, anywhere

### Method 3: LocalTunnel (Alternative)
```bash
npm install -g localtunnel
lt --port 8080
```
